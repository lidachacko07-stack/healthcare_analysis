This project demonstrates my ability to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python and Excel-based datasets. The goal is to extract insights through data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization using industry-standard tools.
The analysis is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (eda_01.ipynb), following a structured and reproducible workflow.
